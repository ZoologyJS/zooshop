## Zoo's Shoes - An eCommerce site using MERN stack (React, Express, MongoDB, Node.js) + Bootstrap & Redux

Feel free to visit the live version of this site hosted below:

shopzoo.herokuapp.com

The site has full integration of:

*   User accounts/login state management
*   Shopping cart system
*   Checkout flow
*   PayPal (and future Stripe payment) checkout
*   Pagination
*   Catalog search

##### **Nothing is actually for sale, and while checkout works, it uses a sandbox version of PayPal.**
